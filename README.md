# Desktop cow
Desktop cow is a tiny, wobbly companion that wanders around your screen and keeps you company while you work, code, or stare into the void. It's cute. It's aimless. It's a cow.

"Not all who wobble are lost✨" – Probably the Cow

## Features ✨
- Summon a desktop cow with a single line of code
- Arrow keys influence direction, but the cow ultimately does her own thing
- It wanders! It wabbles!
- More interactions and mischief coming soon...

## To summon your cow:
```
from pet import Pet

Pet()
```

## Installation
Clone this repo and run it directly.

## Roadmap
Planned features include:
- More interactable cow (pet it, feed it, moo back)
- Mood system (she might get grumpy or sleepy)
- Multiple cow skins (clown cow? disco cow?)
- Reactions to idle time or typing

## Contributing
Got cow ideas? Spotted a bug in the pasture? Contributions welcome!

## Disclaimer
This is a small, silly desktop pet for fun and comfort. It will not organize your life. But it might improve your day a little ✨
